	I am a postgraduate student at Imperial College, London, currently undertaking the first of four years here. I have received funding to complete a Master of Research in Biomedical Research, which is what I am doing now, followed by a 3 year PhD in the Dept. of Bioengineering. I am completing the first of my two projects for the MRes in Biomedical Research in the <a id="niamh" href= "http://openwetware.org/wiki/Nowlan:People">Developmental Biomecianics Lab</a> looking at how movement affects prenatal hip joint formation, as hip dysplasia occurs in up to 1 in 100 babies, and can lead to early onset osteoarthritis in the longer term </p>.

<p class="paragraph"> <em><strong>2009-2012:</strong></em><br>
	My keen interest in osteoarthritis came about during the final year of my undergraduate degree, BEng in Biomedical Engineering at Queen Mary, University of London, when I was exploring research areas for my final year project. I was surprised by how many gaps there were in the published literature on osteoarthritis, and consequently, how much there is still left to find out about the disease! I saw this as an oppotunity- an opportunity for me to make a difference to the lives of many people, as osteoarthritis affects a huge proportion of the population. Therefore, my project, supervised by <a id="tina" href="http://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/?t.t.chowdhury">Dr. Tina Chowhury</a>, involved investigating how oxygen tension affects the catabolic activity of cartilage cells (chondrocytes), and whether fibronectin fragments are responsible for any catabolic activity observed. <br><br> An oxygen gradient exists in healthy cartilage, with oxygen tension being much higher at the upper surface (at the cartilage-joint interface) than the lower surface (at the bone-cartialge interface) becuase cartilage doesn't have a blood supply, and so, chondrocytes must obtain their oxygen and nutrients via diffusion from the synovial fluid. It is believed that this oxygen gradient is disrupted as osteoarthritis develops, so it may be possible to slow down osteoarthritis progession by contolling the oxygen tension of cartilage. In the project, we measured the catabolic activity of chondrocytes by the amount of nitric oxide produced, as overproduction of this molecule has been found to contribute significantly to chondrocyte death and progressive cartilage destruction. We found that in an oxic (oxygen-rich) environment, chondrocytes produce significantly less nitric oxide compared with when they are in a hypoxic or anoxic environment. Additionally, we found that fibronectin fragments play a key role in increasing nitric oxide production, becuase in the absence of fibronectin fragments, significantly less nitric oxide was produced. We also looked at the rate of breakdown of glycoaminoglycans, which are a major component of the carilage matrix, but becuase the experiment was only conducted over 48 hours, no changes in glycosaminonglycan concentration were observed. This project was awarded the Insitutuion Best Project by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and you can read the full project report here <a href=" "></a>. </p>

    In 2012 I took on a new challenge; A masters at Oxford University. Although slightly overwhelmed at first, my coursemates, college friends, and the badminton team helped me to become accustomed to 'life as an Oxford student'. The course was (unexpedtedly!) very mathematical, which, in addition to helping me overcome my fear of matlab, allowed me to better understand the complex engineering behind life-changing medical imaging tools such as MRI and PET. Currently, there is no method of diagnosing early stage osteoarthritis (i.e. before the onset of symptoms), but the medical imaging field is rapidly advancing, so there is great hope of a diagnostic imaging tool being developed in the near future! As my individual project at Queen Mary was very biological, for my MSc individual project, I decided to delve into the world of mechanical testing. Unbeknown to me before I started my project, tendons, like cartilage, degenerate as we get older, making them more susceptible to being torn or ruptured, and very difficult to repair. The long term failure rate of surgically repaired tendons is currently too high (reported to be between 50 and 90 % depending on age and tissue health), and so, lots of research is being carried out to develop better surgical techniques. When large tears form in degenerate tendon, re-tears are the major source of failure after surgery, becuase the tendon tissue is not strong enough to withhold the sutures used to 'sew' the tendon back together again. Hence, often a material is placed over the sutured repair, to provide greater support and mechancial strength, but thus far, with little success. I investigated, under the supervision of <a id="mark" href= http://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/profiles.php?profile=mthompson>Dr. Mark Thompson</a> and <a id="andrew" href= http://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/profiles.php?profile=acarr>Prof. Andrew Carr</a>, the mechanical properties of several materials currently used by surgeons in tendon repair, and obesrved their microstructure, to identify a link between optimal mechancial properties and microstructural pattern. The thesis I produced can be viewed <a id="thesis" href=" http://www.scribd.com/doc/192517494/Oxford-MSc-Thesis">here</a> and in summary, I was able to conclude that. I was awarded a distinction, and received the Prof. Sir Michael Brady Prize for the Best Performance in the MSc in Biomedical Engineering <a id ="prize" href="http://www.ibme.ox.ac.uk/research/regenerative-medicine/mechanobiology/copy_of_News%20-%204YP%20firsts">(IBME news).</a></p>

    And so, I am now on the (albeit long) final straight as a student! Thankfully, I am a funded student, having received a fully-funded scholarship from the Centre of Pathology of Osteoarthritis at Imperial College, so I can enjoy all the benefits of a student, without accumulating a huge student debt <img id="happy" src="http://www.i2clipart.com/cliparts/e/e/c/6/clipart-two-thumbs-up-happy-smiley-emoticon-512x512-eec6.png">! I'm really excited about what the next three and a half years hold, and look forward to 2017, when (fingers crossed!!) I will graduate from Imperial College with a Doctrate in Bioengineering and Biomedicine for Osteoarthritis.    </p>
