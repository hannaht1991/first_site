<p>I am a postgraduate student at Imperial College, London, and am undertaking the first of four years here. I have received funding to complete a Master of Research in Biomedical Research, which is what I am doing now, followed by a 3 year PhD in the Dept. of Bioengineering. My keen interest in osteoarthritis came about during my final year of my undergraduate degree, BEng in Biomedical Engineering at Queen Mary, University of London, when I was exploring research areas for my final year project. I was surprised by how many gaps there were in the published literature on osteoarthritis, and consequently, how much there is still left to find out about the disease! I saw this as an oppotunity- an opportunity for me to make a real difference to the lives of many people, as osteoarthritis affects a huge proportion of the population. Therefore, my project, supervised by Dr Tina Chowhury (<a href="http://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/?t.t.chowdhury">Profile page</a>) involved investigating how oxygen tension affects the catabolic activity of cartilage cells (chondrocytes), and whether fibronectin fragments are responsible for any catabolic activity observed. <br> In normal cartilage, there is an oxygen gradient, with oxygen tension being much higher at the upper surface (at the cartilage-joint interface) than the lower surface (at the bone-cartialge interface) becuase cartialge doesn't have a blood supply, and so, chondrocytes must obtain their oxygen and nutrients via diffusion from the synovial fluid. It is believed that this oxygen gradient is disrupted as osteoarthritis develops, so it may be possible to slow down osteoarthritis progession by contolling the oxygen tension of cartilage. In the project, we measured the catabolic activity of chondrocytes by the amount of nitric oxide produced, as overproduction of this molecule has been found to contribute significantly to chondrocyte death and progressive cartilage destruction.   </p>
