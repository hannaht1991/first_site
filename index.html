<p class="paragraph" id="first"> <br> Getting active and staying active is essential if you are to have a healthy life. Physical activity definitely doesn't have to be a chore and hard work, team games such as badminton and football can be sociable and great fun, and exercise can even be relaxing, such as a walk in the countryside with your family. Keeping active is not only important to keep at a healthy weight, keeping your heart and brain healhty and strong, it also <strong> helps to delay the onset of osteoarthritis </strong> (OA)! So, if you're not already doing some exercise and raising that heart rate a few times a week, surely you have enough of an incentive to start now!?</p>
<p class="paragraph1" id="second"> <br>OA is a degenerative disease, which, although occurs predominantly in weight-bearing joints such as the hip and knee, can affect many other joints too. There is a lot of research being carried out worldwide in an attempt to better understand what OA is, why it develops and how we can detect it before its symptoms arise. Hopefully these findings will help lead to better treatment therapies, and ultimately, a cure! I have set up this website in an attempt to share with you some of the novel (and very exciting!) findings of this reseach.</p>
