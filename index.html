<p>If you're anything like me (<a href="aboutme.html">About me</a>), you enjoy keeping active - whether it be playing badminton with friends, having a kick about with your housemates, or simply going for a walk with your family. If you do enjoy keeping active, you'll be pelased to hear, (if you haven't already), that <strong>exercise helps to delay the onset of osteoarthritis </strong> (OA)! So, if you're not already doing some exercise and raising that heart rate a few times a week, surely thats enough of an incentive to start now!?<br> <br>
OA is a degenerative disease, which, although occurs predominantly in weight-bearing joints such as the hip and knee, can affect many other joints too. There is a lot of research being carried out worldwide in an attempt to better understand what OA is, why it develops and how we can detect it before its symptoms arise. Hopefully these findings will help lead to better treatment therapies, and ultimately, a cure! <br><br>
I have set up this website in an attempt to share with you some of the novel (and very exciting!) findings of this reseach, without you having to extract the key information from (usually very complex) journal articles<br><br>
If you'd like to know some more about the background of osteoarthritis, click here, otherwise, proceed to the novel information by clicking on any of the following links, or use the navigation toolbar at the top of the page: Osteoarthritis prevention	Osteoarthritis treatment </p>
