<p class="paragraph"> Getting active and staying active is essential if you are to have a healthy life. Additionally, doing exercise can be a great way to meet new people and spend time with family and friends; team games such as badminton and football can be sociable and great fun, exercise classes at your local leisure center are a fantastic way to meet new people, and a stroll in the countryside with your family on a Sunday morning may be a perfect way to de-stress and enjoy some family time. Keeping active is important, not only to maintain a healthy weight and keep your heart and brain healhty and strong, but also <em> to delay the onset of osteoarthritis </em>! So, if you're not already doing some exercise and raising that heart rate a few times a week, surely you have enough of an incentive to start now!?</p>
<p class="paragraph"> Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease, which, although occurs predominantly in weight-bearing joints such as the hip and knee, can affect many other joints too. There is a lot of research being carried out worldwide in an attempt to better understand what osteoarthritis is, why it develops, and how we can detect it before its symptoms arise. Hopefully the findings of this research will lead to better treatment therapies, and ultimately, a cure! This website is a way for you to keep up to date with the latest research in osteoarthritis, and hence, any exciting developments!  </p>
<p class ="paragraph"> If you'd like to find out more about the background of osteoarthritis, you're welcome to read my undergraduate disseration by <a id="click" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/192516759/Final-year-project">clicking here</a>. Otherwise, please use the navigator at the top of the page to either read about novel findings from the latest research into OA, to find out more about Hannah, or to contact her.</p>
