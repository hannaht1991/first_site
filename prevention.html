		Obestity is a major risk factor for osteoarthritis, so try to keep your BMI is within the'healthy range' - <span> It has been shown that if you have a BMI>25, by losing approx 5 kgs (which is equivalent to a decrease in BMI by 2 units), you can reduce your risk of knee osteoathritis by as much as 50% (2)!</span> If you are obese/overweight, you produce an excessive amount of a hormone called <b>leptin</b>. Too much leptin in the synovial fluid of joints is thought to be a possible cause of osteoarthritis (1). Also, if you are obese, you're hips and knees have to withstand abnormally high loads, which may be another reason why obese people are at greater risk of osteoarthritis. </div>

women.</div>

			It has been shown in many clinical trials that obese people are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. Although the exact role of leptin in cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis is not yet fully understood, the fact that it has been found to be a cartilage degrading factor is exciting becuase it could be a target for new treatment strategies. </div>

		This figure illustrates a possible way in which leptin contributes to cartilage degeneration in obese people. In obese people, the excessive leptin production leads to increased production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 and 3, nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin (Il)-6. MMP 1 and 3, NO and Il-6 are all catabolic molecules which cause cartilage degeneration when produced in too high quantities (1).

			<p> If you play a sport regularly that puts your joints under very high loads, such as weight lifiting and marathon running, or sports where injuries are common, injury prevention prgorammes are critical (1). Injury prevention programmes can reduce the risk of injury bu one third, and serious injury by one half, as they focus on improving awareness and control of hips, knees and ankles during standing, running, changing direction, jumping, and landing (2). A sport-specific warm up is a crictical component, and  should cover cardiovascular  (such as running), technique (focussing on movements that often cause injury)- an example is correct lower limb alignment during running as shown below (2), <img id="injury" src= "http://www.bmj.com/highwire/filestream/429615/field_highwire_fragment_image_m/0/F2.medium.gif"> balance, and strength exercises (3). A key focus of training for sports like football, rugby etc should be to improve the strength of muscles needed to strengthen hamstrings, quadriceps, and core.</p>
