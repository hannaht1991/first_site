		<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3"> Combining strengthening, flexibility and aerobic exercise (either on land or in water) will help to better manage knee osteoarthrtis (1). <br>
		As pain may be too severe to carry out land-based activities, aquatic exercises should be carried out initially, with the aim of improvng physical ability, so land-based exercises can then be performed (2). </div>
		<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3">Improved pain and function if exercises that improve the three aforemetioned components of fitness (strength, flexibility and aerobic) are carried out (1). Aquatic exercise has been found to reduce pain in the short term, but less significant benefits were found in the longer term, which is why land-based exercise should be carried out when possible (N.B aquatic exercise is more commonly known as hydotherapy i.e. undertaking exercises in water maintained between 32-36 degrees centigrade) (2). </div>
		<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3">A review of all the literature since 2002 concluded that said exercises are benefitial to patients with knee osteoarthtritis, and it is unlikley that any future trials will fail to support this. The effect of balance/relaxation exercises such as t'ai chi were not investigated in this study.</div>

			<p> <strong> Prehabilitation (peoperative exercise intervention)</strong> <br> Currently severe osteoarthritis of the hip/knee is treated with a total joint replacement (1). The aim of prehabiliation is to improve the strength of muscles, tendons and ligaments surrounding the osteoarthritic joint prior to a total joint replacement, in order to enhance post-surgery rehabilitation and functional ability (2). Most of the programmes that have been tested thus far comprise three components; resistance training, flexibility, and step training, and have been completed by the patients three times a week approx 1-2 months before surgery (2,3). An example programme (taken from (1)) is shown below.<br> <img id="exercise" src="http://i.imgur.com/aBRhU49.png?1"></p>
			</div>
		<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3">
			<p> Results from pilot clinical trials have been very promising, and indicate that prehabilitation can improve the quality of life of people who undergo joint replacement becuase of severe osteoathritis. Findings of studies include improved quadriceps strength, functional ability (better performace at several functional tasks, such as walking up strairs, when compared with patients who did not undergo perhabilitation) 1 and 3 months after surgery (1,2,3,4) and reduced pain (2).</p> 
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-3">
			<p> There is significant support for prehabiliation in the literature, due to promising results in trials. While prehabilitation has almost unanimously been found to improve strength and function, pain reduction has less frequentlybeen reported. An explaination for this may be that a longer prehabilitation period (>2 months), and hence stronger muscles, is required in order to see significant improvements in pain. </p>

			<p> <b>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection</b> <br> Clinical trials are currently underway (particularly for knee OA), but the optimal plasma concentration and timing of injections of are not yet known - hopefully results of clinical trials will answer these questions! </p>

		<div class="col-md-3">
			<p> Significant short term (less than 12 months) improvement in pain, stiffness and functional capacity-> better quality of life (1)! In the longer term (24 months after receiving injection), however, the benefits of the PRP treatment are signficantly reduced (2). No complications such as infection, DVT, fever etc have been observed (1,2). </p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-3">
			<p> In 1 and 2, the number of, and time between, injections was different (1= 2 injections, 4 weeks apart; 2= 3 injections, 21 days apart), illustrating the need to identify an optimal protocol. As clinical trials have found PRP injections capable of yielding only short-term improvements thus fay, we need to identify whether they are capable of generating long term benefitial effects, if adminstered in an optimal way. Also, the benefits of PRP injections have only been characterised using questionaires and functional exercise; the use of MRI/CT is required to identify if the injections help to rebuild degenerated osteoarthritic cartiage. </p>
